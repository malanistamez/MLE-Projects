**Capstone Project Proposal: Predicting Housing Prices with Machine Learning**

**1. Project's Domain Background:**

The real estate industry holds significant importance in driving economic growth and shaping urban landscapes. Analyzing housing market dynamics is essential for various stakeholders, including prospective homebuyers and governmental policymakers. A multitude of factors, such as property location, size, amenities, and broader economic indicators, intricately affect housing prices, rendering it a multifaceted yet critical domain for predictive modeling.

Historically, the real estate market has exhibited cycles of boom and bust, influenced by factors such as changes in interest rates, economic recessions, and regulatory policies. The seminal work of Case and Shiller (1987) examined the cyclical nature of housing markets, highlighting the role of speculative behavior and psychological factors in driving price fluctuations. This historical perspective underscores the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics and developing predictive models to mitigate risks and inform decision-making.

Moreover, advancements in technology and the proliferation of data have transformed the real estate industry, ushering in an era of data-driven decision-making. Machine learning techniques, in particular, have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing vast datasets and uncovering patterns that traditional methods may overlook. Researchers, such as Chen et al. (2019), have explored various machine learning approaches for predictive modeling in real estate, ranging from linear regression to ensemble methods like XGBoost and random forests.

Personal Motivation: Investigating the intricacies of the housing market and employing machine learning to predict housing prices aligns with my interest in data-driven decision-making and its real-world applications. Understanding how various factors interact to influence housing prices not only presents a fascinating intellectual challenge but also holds practical implications for individuals and communities alike. By delving into this domain, I aim to contribute to the advancement of predictive modeling techniques and explore opportunities to enhance decision-making processes in real estate and urban planning contexts.


**2. Problem Statement:**
The objective of this project is to develop accurate and interpretable machine learning models for predicting housing prices. This involves addressing several challenges, including feature selection, model complexity, and data heterogeneity. By leveraging advanced regression techniques and integrating diverse datasets, we aim to create predictive models that provide reliable estimates of housing prices across different geographical areas and market conditions.

**3. Datasets and Inputs:**

For this project, the primary dataset will consist of historical housing transaction data sourced from reputable public repositories or real estate databases. This dataset will encompass a diverse array of attributes, including property characteristics (e.g., size, type), location details (e.g., neighborhood, city), transaction dates, and corresponding sale prices. 

In addition to the primary dataset, supplementary data sources will be integrated into the analysis. These may include demographic information (such as population density, age distribution), socioeconomic indicators (such as income levels, employment rates), and macroeconomic trends (such as interest rates, inflation rates). The incorporation of these supplementary datasets aims to enrich the predictive modeling process by capturing broader contextual factors that influence housing prices.

The characteristics of the primary dataset will be thoroughly explored to understand its structure, granularity, and any potential data quality issues. Exploratory data analysis techniques will be employed to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and assess correlations between features. Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, will be applied as necessary to ensure the dataset is suitable for training machine learning models.

The combined datasets will be partitioned into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model development and evaluation. The training set will be used to train various machine learning algorithms, while the validation set will be utilized for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Finally, the test set will serve as an independent dataset to assess the generalization performance of the trained models.

So the training set has 1460 rows and 81 features. The test set has 1459 rows and 80 features.
