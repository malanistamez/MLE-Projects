# Kaggle House Prices through AWS SageMaker

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use AWS SageMaker to tackle the "House Prices" Kaggle competition. The notebook walks through the process of setting up a SageMaker environment, loading the dataset from Kaggle, training a machine learning model, and making predictions on housing prices.

## Notebook Overview

- **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the project and sets the context for using SageMaker.
- **Environment Setup**: Guides users through setting up their AWS environment, including creating a SageMaker notebook instance.
- **Data Preparation**: Demonstrates how to download and preprocess the dataset from Kaggle.
- **Model Development**: Utilizes SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm for training a regression model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance using mean squared error.
- **Conclusion**: Offers insights and reflections on using SageMaker for the project.
