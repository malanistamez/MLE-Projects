## Background

### LLM in Medical Sector: Relevance
In medical science, managing vast amounts of data is routine. This data holds the potential to uncover insights, aid diagnostics, and bolster research. LLMs like Llama 2 offer a method to tap into this potential by transforming unstructured data into structured formats.

### Why Llama 2?
[Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) by Meta AI offers enhanced natural language understanding and knowledge retrieval. Its grammar utilization aligns seamlessly with our objective of structuring medical data.

### Leveraging llama.cpp
Our project utilizes [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), a C++ adaptation of Llama, facilitating a robust pipeline for medical data processing.
